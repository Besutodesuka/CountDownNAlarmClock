2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bin/min/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bin/min/hrs_ctr[5]_i_2/O, cell bin/min/hrs_ctr[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bin/sec/sec_ctr_reg[4]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bin/sec/min_ctr[5]_i_2/O, cell bin/sec/min_ctr[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT bin/min/hrs_ctr[5]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 6 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[0], bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[1], bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[2],
bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[3], bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[4], bin/hr/hrs_ctr_reg[5]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT bin/sec/min_ctr[5]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 6 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
bin/min/min_ctr_reg[0], bin/min/min_ctr_reg[1], bin/min/min_ctr_reg[2],
bin/min/min_ctr_reg[3], bin/min/min_ctr_reg[4], bin/min/min_ctr_reg[5]
Related violations: <none>
